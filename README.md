# üìä Analyzing Google Play Store Data

I have performed an in-depth analysis of Google Play Store data to understand the factors contributing to an app's success, such as user ratings, number of installs, and category trends. This analysis aims to help developers and businesses optimize their app offerings.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

Link to the datasets: [Kaggle - Google Play Store Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utshabkumarghosh/android-app-market-on-google-play)

I used two datasets from Kaggle related to over 9000 apps from 20+ categories, along with app reviews for this analysis. The datasets are:

- **apps.csv**: Contains 14 columns related to the apps listed on Google Play Store
- **user_reviews.csv**: Contains 5 columns related to the reviews received by each app and the corresponding sentiment

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Data Exploration
- Loaded the datasets and stored them in pandas dataframes
- Imported necessary libraries

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

  - Average rating of apps is 4.17
  - Average size of each app is 20.41 MB
  - Most reviews are positive

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
- Utilized various graphs using matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud libraries
- Key visualizations include:
